# bringing the day (letter of Abigail)

To take the Time for Myself,
In the dew and shining sun,
First light, ready or not,
Alone without loneliness,
Sipping thoughtfulness,
Cool water or hot tea,

To Enjoy the Act of Waking Up,
To Cook and to Clean...mmmm,
A Struggle; find The Groove,
Tired, only when out of bed,
even the sun slept in,
First to rise,

Kindness, Please.
Planned improvising,
Visualizing perspectives,
Motives of Tasteful,
Thoughtful Clarity,

Relaxing, Listening, eyes closed,
Stretching, Bloodflow, Motion, Drinking Water,
Creating, Music, Observing, Memories, Connecting,
Awareness, Empathy, Concept, Learning, Connecting,
Human Body...Physiology, Grey areas,
Proficiency, Therapist,
Ones that follow where my mind wanders,
Ones that  I could Say "I Most Definitely have the TIme for This"

The sense of Time, the sense of,
The beginning is refreshing,
Moment alone,
Experienced Cold.
Welcomed... Cold.
Appreciation, Gratitude, Confort...fire,
And it is so Real,
