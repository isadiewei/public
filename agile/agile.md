Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

 We follow these principles:

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

willingness to complete something is defined by the adherence to long term goals
achieved by visualizing success, prepar{ing|ed} logistics, building mastery

Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.

recording thoughts and distortions
in motion allows for replacement of unhealthy patterns
and as such more chesive, consistent progress
moving forward as visualization is paramount to success

Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.

Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.

Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.

The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.

Working software is the primary measure of progress.

Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.

Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.

The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.


---

work together through changing requirements
true to your personality outside of work
help the other parties understand how you think about the problem
and respond with a motivation environment and sustainable progress
toward perfecting techniques hewn from an iterative mining of 
designs from events of our shared past
