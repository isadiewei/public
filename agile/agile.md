# agile methodology, revised

> project exists in honor of https://agilemanifesto.org/

focusing on the sancticty of time, 
and the face to face personability, 
of all our motivated individual work,
in applying themselves as volunteers,
we create our valuable contributions and interactions,
saving what is needed for further generations collaboration,
prioritizing collaboration over contract negotiation,
processes or awakening tools of potentially-aware assistence,
sustained indinitely over the time of our teams coherence,
under the acceptance of change and consequence,
we maintain our willingness to complete tasks,
by visualizing and preparing for our success,
building mastery of surrounding environments,
and adjusting our teamwork effectively,
to deliver technical excellence always,
to tune ourselves for future problems,
and adjust as we are able and required,
for cohesiveness and replacement of unhealthy patterns,
we view this as the path to competancy for our peers,
doing so simply and without loosing sight,
of your highest priority
