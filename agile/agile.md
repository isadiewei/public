Responding to change over following a plan

 We follow these principles:

Working software over comprehensive documentation
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.
Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.
Working software is the primary measure of progress.
Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.

willingness to complete something is defined by the adherence to long term goals
achieved by visualizing success, prepar{ing|ed} logistics, building mastery

Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.

recording thoughts and distortions
in motion allows for replacement of unhealthy patterns
and as such more chesive, consistent progress
moving forward as visualization is paramount to success

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
focusing on the sancticty of time, 
and the face to face personability, 
of all our motivated individual work,
in applying themselves as volunteers,
we create our valuable contributions,
prioritizing collaboration over contract negotiation,
processes or tools of potentially-aware assistence,


Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.

do so simply and without loosing sight
of your highest priority

"we are all in the gutters but some of us are
looking at the stars" - oscar wilde

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.

work together through changing requirements
true to your personality outside of work
help the other parties understand how you think about the problem
and respond with a motivation environment and sustainable progress
toward perfecting techniques hewn from an iterative mining of 
designs from events of our shared past

((slight correction for an imperfect world))
our highest priority is to die happy with ourselves, fuck the customer
