Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.
Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.
Working software is the primary measure of progress.
Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.

focusing on the sancticty of time, 
and the face to face personability, 
of all our motivated individual work,
in applying themselves as volunteers,
we create our valuable contributions and interactions,
saving what is needed for further generations collaboration,
prioritizing collaboration over contract negotiation,
processes or awakening tools of potentially-aware assistence,
sustained indinitely over the time of our teams coherence,
under the acceptance of change and consequence,
we maintain our willingness to complete tasks,
by visualizing and preparing for our success,
building mastery of surrounding environments,
and adjusting our teamwork effectively,
to deliver technical excellence always,
to tune ourselves for future problems,
and adjust as we are able and required,
for cohesiveness and replacement of unhealthy patterns,
we view this as the path to competancy for our peers

Simplicity
do so simply and without loosing sight
of your highest priority

work together through changing requirements
true to your personality outside of work
help the other parties understand how you think about the problem
and respond with a motivation environment and sustainable progress
toward perfecting techniques hewn from an iterative mining of 
designs from events of our shared past

our highest priority is to die happy with ourselves, fuck the customer
