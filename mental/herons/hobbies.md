> not everything is something I do regularly, these are things I have enjoyed having as part of my living.
> file is multipurpose becuase it shows my parents were generous enough to provide me with opportunities,
> in addition to the boy scouts, also it's probably why I was diagnosed with an attention defficit disorder
> the world is a fascinating place, if you're always worried about how you are, you'll forget where you are,
> and what you could be doing, genuinely kinda bored of doing all this 'alone', find yourself a partner and team,
