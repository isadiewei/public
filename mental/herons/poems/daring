# Creative

daring is unhinged, unedited, unfilted, untainted, uncompromising,
unrestricted, unapologetic, unyeilding, understanding of the world,

cyclic in nature it grasps the will to start pushing the boundary forward,
the boundary of freedoms effervescent flourishing of creativity,
creating the momentum needed when actualizing dreams,

creativity is independant, held in the beginnings of thought,
accentuated by its own journey while loosing itself onto blank spaces,
when creativity is unexpressed it spawns relentless anxiousness,
a fear that the thought may never cross the mind again,
dare to start; dare to pursue resolutions to despair,
fruitlessness degraded with trained technique,
assert good mentality and creative will,
letting each new thought flourish,
at the whim of a creative mind
