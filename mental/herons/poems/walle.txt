the universe is under no obligation to make sense to you,
mastering anything in this world requires mastering yourself,
learn and think more than you share,
for the goal you must accomplish,
for finding your start today,
where the present meets your goals,
the wrong people will delay your best,
your worst will rise as you give over take,
when you feel worthless good support will awaken,
admit joy and gratitude in both process and journey,
each day,
