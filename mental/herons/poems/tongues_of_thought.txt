tongues of thought

unrelenting anxious tongue
willfully flicking inside

hostile direct tongue
fitfully flicking outside

an empty skull unfocused, unaware,
holds sunken eyes.

all i do is live in my head,
and worry and wonder where i went wrong,
lacking purpose, holding onto past anger,
still-standing words like still water,
with restless, unawakened, sleep.

like anything else work must be put into clean and promise of prospect,
unaware of how fall he'd fallen viewing the long stairway,
mission to reconcile his memories.

wistful something,
frantically failing his thoughts as life problems,
unphased by stagnation humbled by nothing,

<<
i guess this poem was a little darker than i wanted it to be,
sorry about that
