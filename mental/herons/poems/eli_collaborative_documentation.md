# Collaborative Documentation in Leadership Organizations

> The Roy and Marcia Armes Engineering Leadership Institute (ELI)

ELI provided the sandbox environment I needed to grow as a leader,
it was a relatively simple organization with no official executive board,
instead by coordinating its activities through writing and documentation,
it remained active and efficient, thinking in systems has always worked for me,
travel system, mental and mindset system, cook system, and ELI represents that,
the notes we took prioritized take-aways and recorded history, planned modules,
tracked goals, and gave us opportunity to drive towards the essence of a person,
via their leadership and personality, it exists in a rigid yet flexible system,
and I attribute that to the tootilidge of Jon and Dean Toole,
thank you for good mentality and mental challenge
