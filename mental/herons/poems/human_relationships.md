# human relationships advice from crickets

If you are close to them, 
And once you feel settled, 
And both have a stable job,
And if you have a reason for wanting them in your life,
Are ready to be vulnerable in life directions, emotions,
And share your personal space, but able to set healthy boundaries,
This is the foundation for a healthy relationship with another human,

Also have house plants those bitches rock
