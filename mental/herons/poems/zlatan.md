## Step 1 Accepting You Cannot Become Zlatan Ibrahimovic

read the step title as many times as it takes,

## Step 2 Becoming a vastly vastly inferior version of Zlatan Ibrahimovic

"always two there are" - yoda,
"and yet still too few" - zlatan,

## Step 3 Training Every Day to Accomplish Step 2

begin training,

## Step 4 Now that you have started...

Realize having confidence by compounding your skills,
Can only be gained if you are working towards relevancy,
Those things you want in your life will never be there,
Unless you are willing to touch the ball,

## Step 5 You have been bamboozled

Just like most generic helpful advice you like,
It only works when you identify with an aspect of it,
Whatever those parts of you where growth is important to you,
Find a way to work them in to what you do now,
Otherwise it'll never truely be a part of you,
And for that you'll find yourself lacking,
When step three is where you're stuck,
Don't be hard on yourself,
Before you've even begun,
