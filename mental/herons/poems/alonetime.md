when you have alone time,
that's when you face yourself,
removing external influences,
focusing on the future,
ignoring mindfulness,

health speaking too much time here,
and you will become lost internally,
not enough time here and you will never grow,
you will succeed yes, but without rooting youself,
how will you see how high your leaves have grown
