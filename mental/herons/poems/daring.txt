daring <-> creativity

unhinged
understanding
unedited
unfiltered
uncompromising
unrestricted
unapologetic
unyielding

is daring a cyclic thing?
does it have the potential to be a positive feedback loop?
no, each instance of daring is unique, you cannot make the same leap foward twice
whether successful or failure
the act of acting will change the future
the future is a moving target 
and while the universe may accept many paths
it will correct itself
how i do not know ubt something is driving it

daring is no cyclic but to be daring is
once you attempt to push the boundary it will be a never ending struggle to maintain it
progress in one area can be forgoton or overwhelmed by progress
potentially even in another field
it may turn a daring deed into irrelevancy
---
daring is unhinged, unedited, unfilted, untainted, uncompromising,
unrestricted, unapologetic, unyeilding, understanding of the world
with the same mentality
to act or assert your will upon it.
confidence without activity is cocky
actions without direction is pointless futility
both will lead to fruitlessness and despair
aimless untrained technique

pushing the boundary of freedom 
daring creates more space for creativity to flourish
because the space is created the momentum
to push the boundary further is easier

creativity is independant.
it requires nothing to begin for it is the beginning, the journey, and the circumstances of the end.
to say creativity requires something limits the potential of the thing itself
and shows a lack of understanding.
an individual trapped in a box without need for sustenance or relief
will still find new and unique ways to ither encourage
or torture themselves
the later is more likely when a mind is creative and stuck by environment
or self-impoased restrictions.
when creativity is not given a chance to express itself it will, or often,
becomes resentful anxiety;
while creativity requires nothing freedom gives it the ability to flourish,
without that the soul will remain unfufilled.

not a proficient idiot, yourself is something to prioritize
go about your business, conduct yourself according to it
a just moral compass however it is better to save that identification for another day
it is unfortunate that it is an easy trap to fall in
where you face the controversy between 
what you want to do to support those around you
and what you must do to support long term growth
the major characteristics of these seem to be sleep, food, and communication.
i think most or all peope with for autonomy to produce or contribute ideas
objects, or service to the community which they live in,
and possibly futher geographic (or spatial) boundaries beyond the borders drawn
it's tempting to limit yourself by wishing to understand everything and
you first before moving on yet there's a school of thought where you need
to learn enough to be dangerous before moving on to the next project
all the while re-interpreting that which you have learned in order to build
a better foundation for yourself through your passions
identifying these passions
is a difficult and ardous task we all must go thought in out lives
butthe facade is that we cannot stop the process after a certain age
we must accept that age is a number and being old is the acceptance of the fixed mentality
one that is scared to make a mistake or try something new
i myself can struggle with this concept becasue there is always new challnaged
that i never knew existed until i stepped out my door
the struggle inside to pck what to start out of so many options and possiblities
will tear you apart ou must find a way to seek out where your heart desires
and have the boldness to go for it, 
if you don't you are already self-auditity your works, muting that which lives inside you
this back and forth balance of anxiety offput by your own desire to remain in control
