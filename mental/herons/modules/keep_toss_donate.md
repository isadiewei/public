# Keep-Toss-Donate

> from PickupPlease

when decluttering either 
you keep something, 
toss (trash) something, 
or donate something

let this be a model to use when making donation decisions,
i used it when clearing out the first 25 years of my life,
effective however taxing mentally because of the 
"what if I need this mentality"
try to focus on things you are actively using to keep,
then donate and pay it forward on stuff that is helpful,
do the kitchen and the toolsets last those have the most
"oh i wish i had this still"
kinda stuff because I would never think about measuring cups
I eye-ball and weigh stuff so sometimes it just never occurs to me
