# Tough Conversations

> initial thoughts will revisit them later

these are the conversations that you're never going to feel prepared to have,
every person is different and even though they may have similar problems at some point,
you can never encapsulate everything into one book like the DSM-5,
that's why it's a resource, this module is designed to help you have the conversations you don't know how to have,
so that when a time comes when you can help somebody who is hurting you know how to start,

## Knowing when to have the conversation

here are a few things to lookout for

- mental health warning signs are present see IHELPED
- they don't seem themselves, like something is bothering them (easier to remember)
- you know they have a lot going on in their life, they bring it up a lot
- they come to you for help or try to let you know what's going on

## Knowing what to talk about

- sometimes it's best just for the person to get the words out
- make sure you believe them, it can be frustrating when venting if it doesn't feel heard
- if you know about other things that are going on it may be the time to share, they may be freaking out over lack of information
- try to keep the conversation focused on what's going on with them
- if it seems like they need advice try to give some help but save it for a later date when they can remember it better
- there is usually a larger issue going on that caused them to breakdown, another stressor
- try to not keep records unless it's your job and you know how to document things, this **will** lead to more issues

## Knowing how to follow up

- typically when things happen recommending therapy falls on unwilling people
- it's usually better to bring it up yourself a couple times while recommending therapy
- do not trap the person, it will lead to more resentment and ultimately a worse situation
- typically if they came to you it's because they feel comfortable, that's a good thing, sometimes they have nobody else to talk to about something
- if you know another person with better experience it's okay to ask permission to step out of the conversations, try not to do this abruptly it might make the person feel more lost
