the reason i am so happy to donate all this,
<<
is because i let it bottle up,
all the years of trying to get what i needed to be happy,
never finding it among the stuff i left behind,
but finding everything in what i brought along that road;
except my ipod i love my terabyte ipod and the thing won't charge,

ode to ipod,
oh ipod oh ipod,
how you block out the bad,
and bring in the music,
no matter how sad,
>>
