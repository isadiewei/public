did you know the barracuda has
the highest killstreak at disney?
it's the little things you miss,
pooring over old notes is kinda fun,
kinda strange and kinda miserable,
sometimes you find something,
that makes you think,
which is why i journal,
i may regret this,
i may learn from it,
but because it crossed my mind,
it's a part of me,
even if it's strange or harmless,
and i can come back in a couple weeks,
and reflect on the good stuff
