schedule offers peace => complacency problem
edge of comfort zone, where does the distate of willy-nilly
lifestyle reside deeply unconcious domains

<<
okay this one i'm not exactly sure what happened here
i guess if you can't make a schedule try filling your day with positive things,
stuff you like things you wish you did more often,
and a schedule will form naturally, rhythmically,
and you can then add the timestamps after,
otherwise you'll spend weeks planning the perfect schedule,
and mess it up on the first day, catasrophize and wind up sad,
so just start doing, JUST DO IT -| Shia Lebuf (sorry if i fucked up spelling)
