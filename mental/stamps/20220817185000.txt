grandpa art's birthday,
honestly we didn't do a lot out of the ordinary,
grandpa seems to do all the fun projects when everyone else is out,
and so for the birthday we had flank steak and ice cream, and a partial sunset,
i think it's because while he loves us, he has a high standard for his window stills
nice walk earlier that day

i think i said rosemary flank steak somewhere, that was actually the next day
