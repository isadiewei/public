<<
with mental illness you struggle to maintain a baseline,
this causes faultering success in values and goals,
validating these issues brings it into the light,
and identifying the emotion can help regulate it,
other times music or hugging yourself works,

supposedly the brain releases oxytocin after 20 seconds of physical contact,
this is good for stress relief and companionship
