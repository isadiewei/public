ever think you're supposed to choose love
and make it so everything in your life lined up
just how you dreamed it would?
but then realizing sometimes, just sometimes, mind you
that there are things that you have to doing order to be happy with yourself
and there's nobody that can take that away from you
even if you're only doing it so you can be more present
present in the moment, aware of your gifts or merits
and ready to take on a new day
carpe diem
