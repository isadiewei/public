realizing now, that i am not a great person,
ive made mistakes yes, but learning from them?
not as much as id like, i barely even talk to people,

so here i was transferring back from texas,
it was a tough process and i'm grateful for my parents
helping me restart my life after a lot of chaotic adventuring
