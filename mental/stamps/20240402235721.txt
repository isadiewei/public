grateful for my parents, well
specifically my dad today, I'm not
great with money or people so
he's my savior in that regard,
and my hero otherwise it
was great to go to the park
today, but after years of 
accumulating emotional baggage
it's just not the same as it
was as a kid so cheers to
going back to that part of life
