some of the journals i don't want to discuss as openly which is why if you need to mind dump regret free
here are the steps i recommend on linux, on windows you can use WSL or port it to Windows 

```
# templated 

{this is just a string like "myFile" "myNumber" but use it as replacement}
journal some stuff into a file called {timestamp}.txt

echo "{my random string 127480512897580412}" >> {timestamp}.txt

cat {timestamp}.txt | sha512sum >> {timestamp}.txt

* then go and delete the stuff you journaled, add reminders if you want *

then use {timestamp}.txt as a reminder of the thoughts you just needed to get out

## full example

echo "felixfelicis" >> 20240000000000.txt; cat 20240000000000.txt | sha512sum >> 20240000000000.txt
then do the thoughtsectamy 

feel free to make an efficiency for it but i like the extra work otherwise they'd all be like that
```
