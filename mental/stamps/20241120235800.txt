living nowadays gives you the ability
to feel unseen in proportions never before seen
work in those things you wish were different
even despite those who say it is fine
work them in, iterate, iterate, iterate,
until it becomes mixed with your experiences,
and you may find new pieces of yourself,
which may feel you now cannot live without,
and accept this awakening of yourself,
is who you are meant to be to you,
do not waste it on selfish idealism,
a promise of softer fields tomorrow,
