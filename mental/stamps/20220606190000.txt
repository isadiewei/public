appreciative of my ability to feel fear,
while a longing, aching, hope to be rid of all that troubles me,
without it, as bob ross would say "you can't appreciate the light without the dark"

cat timestamp.txt | sha512sum >> timestamp.txt

helps me keep track of what the dark thoughts were about,
validate and enumerate them but not dwell on them
