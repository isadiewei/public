tattoos as armor,
as most enouraging thought,
to carry with you the trials and reflections,
a encouraging consistent friendship with yourself,
and armor against the changing of the world,
don't let yourself be overrun,
remember the positives of it,
the reason you felt strongly,
the reasons you are you,
