a lot of time i don't think about all the work that goes into something little,
i often get distracted of all that is happening around me,
it's easy to get carried away a loose sight of the real reasons,
so these files are a way for me to step back into it,
move things that built up in the past back out,
reprocessed, revised, and more ~happy~ for i'm lacking a better word right now,
so i focus on the positives, because digging around in the past,
is a way to get lost in it, and for me there's a lot,
maybe i'll try less writing more programming,
might be a good way for me to catch back up
