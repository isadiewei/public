assertive communication comes from within,
while agressive and passive communication comes from without,
overwhelmed might you be by external factors,
or coming from an uncertain place with passive-agressive,
assertive communication is clear and concise,
despite your reason for saying so,
or lacking the power to say no,
avoiding intense reactions,
and unclear direction,
assertive communication removes our guilt,
removes our regrets, leads to full understanding,
because respect grows when we increase our ability to say no,
in a way that communicates we care about the relationship,
enough to give it full understanding,
and assert our healthy boundaries,
