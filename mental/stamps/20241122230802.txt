adventure is out there,
and so easily lost to the turmoil of the day,
rewarded though through and adventurous spirit,
it can be removed or hindered with new experience,
things which for all reason do not fit,
into the world you built inside you,
to find the alignment with the environment beside tou,
and it leads on and on until it seems hopeless,
and unlucky are the few who feel guilty in repairing this,
whether alone and afraid of more input dissolving,
what little peices of themselves they can find,
or leading for fear in sharing what existed before,
finding new hope can feel difficult in this time,
and it is often bettrr to communicate the needs,
to repair this in your way,
regardless of the scared feeling inside,
regardless of where anxious tendancies take us,
