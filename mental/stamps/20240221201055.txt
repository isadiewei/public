## on being a big brother

the big take away of 'being a big brother',
is to show a little sibling all the awesomeness in them,
and to have an inside joke about a special memory,
and possibly a special moment or item,
like the golden ghost's dash/speedometer.

## reflection

today, i went for a nice walk into town,
got some coffee and played with my newly downloaded rockbox software,
on the walk, i realized that so many people are in a rush to get where they need to be,
in order to work, which i haven't been, just to survive,
and that leaves little time for the nice things,
like being in the sun, solving a problem,
or when you can't solve one,
making even slight progress,
or at the very minimum,
keeping your passion,
to continue on it,

<<
realizing i still struggle with being patient
like legitimately my speeds are asleep or zoomies
work on finding the middle ground
