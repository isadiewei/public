it's a mystical thing,
the power of fire,
the comfort, the ability to do many things,
cook, power, clean, fuel the modern age,
steel and forges burning bright,
it reminds me of a simpler time,
without so much human inspired craziness,
there's always been new york sure,
but when by a fire for a moment,
you're working with nature,
the physics and their graceful warmth,
makes me happy for a while,
even if it is rainy today,
i'm still comforted by the firelight,
and sure these blurbs seem blurbish,
yet like the fire,
they're peaceful to me

(idk call this one firelight or something)
