see the things in life we take for granted now,
are all processes and tools that assist us in collaboration,
whether it be in a meeting or on a trip to the park 15 minutes away,
all these things bring us together, sometimes for the worse,
but so often for the best that we cannot lose sight of us,
otherwise we exentuate the bad, leaving out the good,
so take pride in the technology that is formed,
and is forming,

and forgive the rushedness of the generations,
who cannot see further than the tools they are provided,
and when we gave them the world in their pockets,
do not run from the power they hold,
and instead learn to cherish them,
