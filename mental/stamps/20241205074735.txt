like sleep gratitude is supposed to be shown daily for best results,
yesterday it was my mom that i needed to show gratitude towards,
i locked my SIM card on accident, then I dropped my phone and it broke,
fortunately had a spare one because I was using them to debug my life
made me realize that in like 3 seconds i lost most of my current life,
contacts, memories, conversations, applications, i wouldn't be able to call her
and thank her if she hadn't come helped me out, also food, food was good,

she'd want me to be safe and happy,
and i'm still worried we're moving in the
right direction, making society more efficient,
but governments are under stress to protect everybody,
they might forget what the experience is like for the individual,
and individuals like me might feel forgotten without family,
and they need support to help out sometimes,
therapy and my family is helping at least,
but that disonnect between technology,
and the groups that protect all,
it's only going to be enhanced,
hopefully not in a bad way,

technology has so many good uses, 
health research is the one I'm grateful for,
in addition to the other stuff,
and obviously my mom again,
despite everything
