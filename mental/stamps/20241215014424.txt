its tough right now
i don't have a lot of control over my life
i have a supporting family so that's good
but with all the therapy and treatment
there's not much else i can do
even if i want to go back to texas
there's plenty to do here
i hope i can find a better way to contribute
finding a job is not going well yet
i have hopes for a few positions
others have found better candidates
i'll find something soon is what i tell myself
but there's so much i had left to do
not sure if it will get done now
and i feel like i'm rambling
at least the weather was nice today
got some exercise and 
a walk in
yesterday i watched what few stars i could see
from the frozen water
that was nice to do
