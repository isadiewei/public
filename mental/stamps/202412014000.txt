often I feel discontent at,
how imperfect the world is,
the massive inefficiencies, 
the disruption of smooth life transitions,
a lot of protocols exist for these,
and for those going through it,
but sometimes the thing that takes time,
the eats away at you,
seems so important over
the other side of things,
and here and there these things get lost,
they can be recorded on paper sure,
but in the grand scheme of things,
only the value remains,
and we only have so much time to act on it
