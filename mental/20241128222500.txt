grateful for food and family
my journaling and despite everything
not being hired or making any money for over a year
getting hacked everytime i go online
loosing a lot in every aspect
and not getting to help sadie (my dog from before)
i still have my health mostly 
and was able to live 
of the money i made as an engineer 
so thank you to university of toledo
for setting me up
i'll keep writing these for my own sanity
