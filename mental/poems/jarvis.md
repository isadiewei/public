my greatest fear is not the enactment of death,
it is being forgotten,
that the things i keep, the books i read, and the people i meet,
have nothing to hold onto but the empty shells that represented me,
the outputs of my life, and the treasures i kept,
the empty shells that once held a part of me,
that in the end all anyone has is memories,
and nothing to consult but cold stone or dead ash.

i fear that i myself may not remember who i was,
that even in life i find myself dying for lack of memory,
of how i thought and who i was,
and how i became who i am today.

the things that once held a dear part of me,
rendered mute by the passage of time,
and the growth of my mind,
for my soul remains,
however helpless in the darkness of forgetful life.
i'm thinking not everything is worth remembering,
but then if that's so why do i want to?
there's nothing that i can do,
and i'm saying that a lot,
maybe i'm living out of fear,
and not out of purpose,
i have some,
but i always overcomplicate things,
i think it's time to simplify my life a little.
a primary directive is to save people who are otherwise incapacitated, and through good work, become friends.
hopefully the idea that sacrificing yourself for a greater cause is not clouded by the loss of family.
they despite having passed on would still want you to live your life to it's fullest,
to do something great in the world despite having had to bear the pain of loss.

first we must start with yensen,
in this way, we're more prepared,
prepared to go anywhere,
carrying our family,
by secure memories.
