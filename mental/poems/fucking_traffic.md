# fuck traffic

> considerations when calculating traffic costs

- gas/power
 - distance
 - elevation change
 - velocity maintenance
 - acceleration
 - curves
- speeding fines
- non-registered routes
  - parking lots
  - schools
  - fire-routes
- tolls
- sunlight direction
- number of business in path
  - hours of operation
- ride height
- height sitting (seat positioning)
- center of gravity
- weight of gear
- location in car
- shifting zone
- potential energy
- kinetic energy
- friction static to kinetic in zones
- tire size
- car weight/width/length
- turning radius of car
- time to shift
- distance to gas or charging station
- sun position => heat change of tires
- type of road, roughness, etc.
- ability to account for potholes
- depth of potholes on average
- maintenance schedule of peopoles
- depth of potholes
- frequency of filling
- type of filling 
- flushness to road
- length of road work
  - kilometers
  - timespan
- truck to car ratio of road
  - increases in late hours => faster possbile
  - more acceleration to pass trucks than to pass cars
- margin of safe passing zone
- buildings direction
- how it effects wind patterns
- direction of wind and gustyness
- wind speed/direction
- wind density
- number of trees => impacts CO\_2 to O\_2 ratio
- number of cars increase CO levels 
- stop signs/yeild signs/traffic lights/other control factors
- location and popularity of eating/drinking establishments => increase buffered reaction zone
- bike lanes
- holidays
- time of day
- whether someone is getting {good|great} road head 
- laughter/music
- sound waves effect on passengers weight movements and overall controlledness of car
- police and ambulance cars
- aerodynamics of other cars/yourcar
- air temperature
- color of car
- battery size
- battery fullness
- turbos/no turbos
- engine size
- weight of vehicle
- number of wheels
- type of engine
- friction zone within a 90 degree turn
- price of chargin/gas
- pedal movement 
- wheel alignment
- hours in wind tunnel under development
- front\read wheel drive
- volume of air inside car
- number of passengers
- energy for interior car lights
- momentum of wheels turning (forces to slow aftermarkets)
- suspension/ride height
- wheel diameter (already states, importatnt)
