you know it's never really the lyrics that make up my favorite part of this song
it's the atmosphere that it puts me in,
i feel like i'm sitting quietly and watching my life unfold around me,
and finally for once i feel like i'm at peace with my place in the world,
something that i've always wanted to feel,
and yet my concern to remain trapped in it is what makes it so fleeting,
so i love this song because i can travel back into that place in my head,
and it makes that reality of fleetingness a little more bearable
