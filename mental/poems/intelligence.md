# intelligence

intelligence is not something you have
but something you do, it is the culmination,
of all you have learned and all you will learn,
and when joined together creates a path forward,
towards the perfect choice for you admittedly within
the restrictions of all that you do,
and sometimes all that is around,
it is shown when you share,
share your filtering,
your opinion
