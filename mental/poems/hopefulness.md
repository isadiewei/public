# Hopefulness

based on our triggers, our thoughts, our emotions,
mindfulness in the moment, accepting our surrounding environment,
holding the dearest parts of yourself, as the world chips away,
renders you mute and fails to support your growth of mind,
what remains is a soul, a hopefully hopeful personality,

however helpless you feel in the darkness of fortgetful light,
save those around, save those who are otherwise incapacitated,
find good work, passion, promise, things that make life worth living,
that stems the reality of loss, the detriment of destitute ideaologies,

see who you are, secure your memories, make yourself remember the light,
focus on that which comes naturally, that tides frustration in it's place,
overwhelms and subdues the reality of where you are headed,
less things in life, but packed with meaning and memory,
longing to be brought out and shared,
peacefulness and sanctity of thought,

remember who you were, find a memory to stay the death,
the egotistical death necessary for self growth,
comes with it promise of a tomorrow,
if you let go the fear, the fear of being forgotten,
the fear of having your life rendered mute,
that your reality will become an empty shell,
nothing to consult but cold stone or dead ash,


give good will and foster environments for promoting community
to help people and to bask in the sun of a new day for the less fortunate,
vow to keep thy memory dear of those who help and who are helped by you,
give to fair dealings, tolerance, respect, to learn from mistakes often,
for you are not perfect and a leader has stress in bounds,
and often feels unable to share less they harm those around,


foster promote and help every worthy endeavor of those students,
those you mentor, a common goal of growth and livelihood of thought,
treat those around you as partners and day one they will surprise you,
bring a new light to that which you thought to be dead,
the hope that was left flickering in the light,
away from the fuel it needs to burn bright
to understand to world around

feedback differs based on complexity of behaviors,
and there is nothing more complex than the behavior of a friend,
for feeling your heart beat and understanding it are two different things,
and focusing on the promise of comradery and family,
will stem the thoughts that turn these things bleak,
that render you powerless and make you feel weak,
for distilling these thoughts into hope,
is how we carry on and move past
