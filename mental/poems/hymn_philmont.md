silver on the sage,
starlit skies above
aspen covered hills
country that i love
philmont here's to thee,
scouting paradise,
out in god's country ---
tonight

wind whisp'ring pines
eagles soaring high
purple mountains rise
against an azure sky
philmont, here's to thee,
scouting paradise,
out in god's country ---
tonight
