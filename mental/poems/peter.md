# Peter's Laws 

> the creed of the sociopathic obsessive compulsive
> got this from Kennedy Space Center

- if anything can go wrong (fix it ... murphy)
- when given a choice - take both
- multiple projects lead to multiple successes
- start at the top then work your way up
- do it by the book .... but be the author
- when forced to compromise, ask for more
- if you can't beat them, join them, then beat them
- if it's worth doing, it's go to be done right now
- if you can't win, change the rules
- if you can't change the rules, then ignore them
- perfection is not optional
- when faced without a challenge, make one
- "no" simply means begin again at one level higher
- don't walk when you can run
- bureaucracy is a challenge to be conquered with a righteous attitude, a tolerance for stupidity, and a bulldozer when necessary
- when in doubt: THINK!
- patience is a virtue, but persistence to the point of success is a blessing
- the squeaky wheel gets replaced
- the faster you move, the slower time passes, the longer you live
- the best way to predict the future is to create it yourself
