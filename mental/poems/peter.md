# Peter's Laws 

> the creed of the sociopathic obsessive compulsive
> got this from Kennedy Space Center
> no please do not be a sociopath but build stuff for science instead

- if anything can go wrong (fix it with murphy)
  - (plan ahead, prepare for the worst, hope for the best)
- when given a choice - take both
  - (compromise by combining the good points)
  - (find the weaknesses try to compliment both so they are resolved)
- multiple projects lead to multiple successes
  - (try not to fixate on one thing to where it becomes all you are)
- start at the top then work your way up
  - (visualize where you want to be, start working towards it)
- do it by the book .... but be the author
  - ("when we dream we enter a world that is entirely our own; dumbledore")
- when forced to compromise, ask for more 
  - (when doing something you feel uneasy about, solve it with science or reaffirm your boundaries)
- if you can't beat them, join them, then beat them
  - (treat everyone around you as someone that knows more than you and they'll prove you right)
- if it's worth doing, it's go to be done right now
  - (don't delay those things that bring joy to your life)
- if you can't win, change the rules
  - (innovation, invention, creativity and art are all of your own design (obviously try to follow our current undestanding of physics))
- if you can't change the rules, then ignore them
  - (some things in life can't be ignored, but ignore your doubt and set forth on your life's adventure)
- perfection is not optional
  - (perfection is not optional, neither is self-care)
- when faced without a challenge, make one
  - (demand more of yourself and be willing to mark your accomplishments)
- "no" simply means begin again at one level higher
  - (when faced with a choice, try to narrow it down to a couple then run through pavlovs hierarchy of need until an answer presents itself)
  - (every time you increase the level of people you're talking to, revise and expand until you have an infallable option)
- don't walk when you can run
  - (you can't plan while you're doing, when you're planning you need to be reflective;vining, doing, doing yeah you can run more, like a marathon)
- bureaucracy is a challenge to be conquered with a righteous attitude, a tolerance for stupidity, and a bulldozer when necessary
  - (so much history, contribution, and scientific endeavour was crushed by this, all that medical research, science, discovery, started somewhere)
- when in doubt: THINK!
  - (when you're unsure of what you want, try to not get sucked into overthinking, do that by prioritizing what you need to continue worrying because it seems to be what you like doing hmphh)
- patience is a virtue, but persistence to the point of success is a blessing
  - "let's do it", 
  - "it will work", 
  - "it has to work", 
  - "we went over everything", 
  - "don't jinx it", 
  - "it's happening", 
  - "we're doing it", 
  - "yesterday sucked but today is good", 
  - "we will finish this", 
  - "keep working at it, sometimes this part is tricky"
  - "it's alright just a small fix"
  - "you got this"
  - "we can start this part again"
  - "nothing gets in our way"
  - (that's just the first two weeks out of 5200)
- the squeaky wheel gets replaced
  - speak up for yourself, advocate for others when you know enough, if you've been frustrated ask for more help, time, resources, don't ruin everything because you don't know how to communicate
- the faster you move, the slower time passes, the longer you live
  - "by gorlogs beard and nose, this might actually work; john flanagan probably"
- the best way to predict the future is to create it yourself
  - when you wish something was a part of the world, start on it, share your experiences, i love little art reels and stuff like i saw some with dancing leaves people it is beautiful, seriously, there's also a kinda goth? maybe? i forget the distinctions cartoon lady singing a song i love, so when you have a thing that feels like it needs to be created or the world wouldn't it's best possible place, do that thing, if you want to give up that's okay too, share how it went, someone else might pick it up, but you can always come back to it, it's better than doing something you begun to hate over and over and over until you eventually don't even have the passion for it again, (it's okay to pause;ediya)
