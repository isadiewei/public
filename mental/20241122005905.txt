giving power to a thought,
can be good when it is a good thought,
adding action, word, or a plan to those things,
that drive at your spirit enacting a better you,
but consequently can give power to bad thoughts,
which detract and lead you to dismay,
however there may be more power in acknowledgement,
regardless of a thoughts goodness or negativity,
for further review into your own thoughts,
after having progressed in some way,
related or otherwise,
may give you insight into how and why it was,
and who you have now become,
so allowing reflection may give more,
than sheer disregard for that moment,
