> marsha m linehan

## questions

what in your life makes it likely you will have an episode
when are you most vulnerable? when you are hungry, angry, lonely, or tired? be specific
are there people who trigger you? who?
are there people who influence you to make risky decisions or engage in harmful behaviors? who?
what types of situations or kinds of comments set you off?
are there conversation topics that upset you? explain.
are you triggered by scents or smells? songs? anything else you can think of?
are there people, situations, or events you simply need to avoid? explain.
if you cannot avoid them completely, are there other people you have around that can act as "buffers?"
do you need to rearrange your schedule in some way? if yes, describe what you can do.
what can you do differently to ensure you get enough sleep? eat a healthy diet? exercise?
what fcan you do to avoid loneliness?
are there things you can do to better tolerate loneliness?
what else can you do to protect yourself? for instance surround yourself with positive people or take up a spiritual practice.

## plan

identify warning signs (e.g., lack of sleep, stressful work day, overly hungry)
notice triggers (e.g. watching the news, scrolling through social media, talking to a family member)
take precautions (e.g. avoid certain situations, distract yourself, exercise)
-> practice this when you feel set off

```
