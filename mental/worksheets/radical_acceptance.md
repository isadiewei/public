# radical acceptance

- not deeming good, wrong, bad, right, etc.
- reality of situtation not opinionated version
- anger teached nothing about compassion
- waiting for an apology doesn't work either
- don't have to agree or cosign w/situation
- solve/act, stay in pain, accept = 3 options
- willful to do what is needed.
- willingness is long term goal > short term
 - work effectively for long term goal
- as I destroped each project i was leaning to let go
- sieze the limitation
