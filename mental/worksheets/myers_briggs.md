## To Practice Extraversion:

- Join and participate in a social or professional group or club (find a group where the size and frequency of meetings won’t overwhelm you).
- Have lunch with one new social or business contact per week to increase your networking circle and to add breadth to your relationships.
- If you think someone can help you formulate a plan or move it into action, ask him or her for assistance, even if you prefer going it alone.
- Solicit another’s input
- open up with at least one other trusted person -- share what you’re thinking.

## To Practice Sensing:

- Take stock with your five senses periodically. What do you see, hear, smell, taste and touch? What does the air feel like, what do you see around you?
- When going someplace new, pay attention to the route, landmarks, and what your destination looks like.  Note where you park your car and what entrance you use.
- Try to stay oriented to north, south, east and west.
- Stay in the present – frequently check in with what’s actually happening in the moment.
- Focus on what you truly experience and what it means vs. what you make up or infer about it.  Take a situation purely at face value without adding any interpretation or “story” to it.
- Practice relaying direct, specific facts to others.
- Tell a story in more depth than you typically would including precise, exact and accurate details.
- Periodically do a mental scan of people in your life – what’s going on with my daughter? spouse? co-worker?
- Increase your connection with the external world by consistently listening to the news or reading a news paper or news magazine.  Focus on staying informed about key local and world events.

## To Practice Thinking:

- Practice giving simple, direct, to-the-point feedback to others. When feedback comes your way, don’t take it personally; use what’s helpful and ignore the rest.
- Ask yourself if-then and cause-effect questions such as, “If I say ‘yes’ to this, then what do I need to give up?” “What are the effects that result from these actions?”
- Make a decision using an objective framework.   List pros and cons, but don’t include any with emotional content (except for what’s in line with your personal values).  Make a decision based on an analysis of the pros and cons.
- After making a decision using an objective framework, take a tough­ minded stance and hold firm.  Use the information from your analysis to support your position.
- When you believe that something you’ve said or done has hurt someone’s feelings, check in with them to see if your perception is correct.

## To Practice Perceiving:

- Schedule a day to go with the flow.   Note what turns up that adds value to the day.
- Allow a reasonable period of time to elapse (a few hours or a day) before finalizing a decision.  Use the extra time to gather more information or probe for additional insights.
- In solving a problem, think of several options besides the one you think is correct. Make a list of the pros and cons of each option and its impact on people. Challenge your original selection.
- Monitor yourself for a day and see what happens when you allow yourself to be interrupted. Try to increase your tol­erance for delays, ambiguities, and unforeseen changes.
- Don’t answer e-mails or voice mails immediately, wait as long as practical before replying.
- If people want your opinion, try remaining neutral. Give several alternatives and let them decide for themselves.
- Go on an outing with no plans or schedules.  Let others make all the decisions and focus on relaxing and enjoying whatever happens.
