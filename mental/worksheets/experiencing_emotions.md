# Emotions

- you are not your emotion; 
- you do not have to act on the feeling;
- remember times you have felt differently
- don't judge your emotion
- radically accept your emotion as part of you
- practice naming the emotion
- practice willigness to accept experience of the emotion
- alternate coping mechanisms
- bring up historical events (lucky depressed people always are so negatively foused right?)
