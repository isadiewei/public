the reason behind agile is magnificent,
it means you can spend eons of work,
constructing this perfect rocketship,
and when somebody says the paint job is off,
if takes a small change to update it,
because you adhered to technical excellence,
and did the hard part of setting it up,
but then you still get 20th place in
the libraries lego competition,
despite demonstrating teamwork,
and adding on special functionality,
like exterior tool lock ups,
and a refueling supply line
