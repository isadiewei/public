this repository is mostly for references right now,
i have a lot of other stuff i need to dig myself out of,
the coding can come later when i'm not freaking out and overengineering stuff
the firstaid folder is because that stuff is just good to know,
i got most of it from boy scouts and creativity,
if there are issues or corrections,
please reach out so i can fix

also i forgot if you pinball the electrons you can pinball the electron position
