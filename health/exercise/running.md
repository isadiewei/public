## Explanation of Categories:

- **Easy Run**: Steady-paced runs aimed at building aerobic base and endurance at a comfortable pace.
- **Strength Training**: Weight lifting or bodyweight exercises to improve overall strength, with a focus on legs, core, and upper body for stability.
- **Interval Training**: Short bursts of fast-paced running with recovery intervals to improve speed and VO2 max. Key for improving race pace.
- **Hill Repeats**: Running uphill to improve strength, form, and endurance, while simulating the challenges of running at high altitude.
- **Tempo Run**: A sustained, moderately hard effort meant to improve your lactate threshold and stamina.
- **Active Recovery**: Light jogging or hiking to help maintain fitness while allowing the body to recover.
- **Long Run**: The longest run of the week, focusing on building endurance and getting accustomed to the longer distances at high altitude.

## General Tips for High Altitude Training:
1. **Hydration**: Stay hydrated, as high altitude can lead to quicker dehydration.
2. **Pacing**: Your pace will likely be slower at high altitude, so adjust expectations.
3. **Breathing**: You may need to focus on deep, controlled breathing during exercise.
4. **Rest**: Altitude training can be taxing, so donâ€™t underestimate the importance of rest.
5. **Altitude Acclimatization**: If possible, train at higher altitudes gradually to give your body time to adjust to the lower oxygen levels.

This plan is structured to help you improve both your endurance and speed while preparing for a 5K race at high altitude. Make adjustments based on how your body is responding to the increased stress from altitude.
