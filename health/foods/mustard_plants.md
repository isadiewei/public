## notes

### mustard wild
 
> wild mustard is a hearty but hard to eat plant
> by synthesising a crop that can grow anywhere
> we create offspring over time that are suitable
> for that particular environment

#### list of wild mustard offspring

 - broccoli; flower buds
 - kale; leaves
 - cabbage; terminal bud
 - turnips; selection for roots
 - cauliflower; flower buds
 - kohlrabi; stem

### plant breeding

- agronomy; horticulture
- statistic; computer science
- genomics; molecular biology
- bioinformatics
- biotechnology
- big data; robotics
- genetics; biotechnology
- pathology; entomology

### mutation breeding (6-7 years)

- CR4SPRCos9 (S gene targeting ) calliflower
- NBT genome editing (4-6 years)
- S gene disruption (GM free label)

### conventional

- elite variety; disease suceptable
- donor variety; w/resistence
- F_sigma [50,,25,12,6,3]% return changes 
 - (using punnett square)
- genotypes; genetic markers
- phenotypes; exhibited traits
 - stalk weight / leave
 - stalk height
 - kernel position
 - kernel color
 - yield
- traditional breeding
 - crosses plants w/selected offspring
 - mutagenesis exposing thing to radiation
 - RNA interference, switching off genes
 - transgenics intersection selected genes
  - (using recombinant DNA methods)

~> small scale superenhancing punett square progress iterations
 ~> allows for many genes interactive selection per generation, use DNA analysis to identify child plants

### plant problems

- torrential rain (A)

optimizing pod shattering properties to reduce
yield losses due to premature pod shattering

> increases seed spread

- pathogens (B)

engineering of pathogen induced translational
control of key immunity components to confer
disease resistence in host cells

- flood (C)

improving flood survival by engineering SUB1A-1-like
transcription factors which curb plant growth
to escape flood

> plants moving away from flood

- drought (D)

modulation of ABA and auxin pathways regulating
transcription factors 1AA3 and ARF7 promoting
root growth towards moisuture

> plant stays wet

- rising atmospheric C02 (E)

reducing density of stomata, manipulation of stomatal
function and lowering of stomatal conductance

> less stomata less CO_2 chocking

- heat (F)

over expression of heat shock factors which induce
the expression of heat shock-protiens that confer
thermastability - more heat shock protiens
=> more stability

- fertilizer (G)

optimized rooting systems, better nutrient
transport and partitioning, manipulation of microbial
associations 

- salinity (H)

introduction of HKT1 which mediates removal
of sodium from the xylem in roots preventing
over-accumulation of sodium in leaves

- sweet corn, kernels [77-100] calories
- steel cut oats, {389 calories, 17g protien, 7g fat, 66g carbohydrates, 106dg fiber}

- ivory coast
 - cocoa beans, petroleum oils, unwrought hold, natural rubber, cashews, coconuts
 - redirect imperfect via misfits market to ivory coast,
  - high exports to europe established distribution operations to rest of Africa

- wild mustard useful for rapid prototyping, precedurs once
 efficient bridged to more coloric dense foods

~ feed my starving children, {oats,grains,protient powder, nuts}
~ add raw glucose tidbits like glucose w/frosting wrapping
 as in basic-four cereal
~ eff filtering/dehydrating -> binding agent for limited water
 varieties, twinkies for taste of desserrt or oreos/cookies
- cows -> manure -> fertilizer -> worms -> +recycling -> fertilizer
 --> sowings (w/ re-engineered crops)

genotype inspection
-> rapid generation -> phenotype validation
-> off product -> m.market

**swappy the worms with new compost => more worms, replace compost buckets**

N^(-) (nitrogen) most abundant in fertilizer/earth-air
add the phospholipid bi-layer transfats notes

*plant* + CO2 ~> O2 | (row given oxygen), 2(HOH2C6) + (oxygen)

steric acid given (O=COH) + (amino acid histidine (HIS))
