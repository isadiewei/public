This is my place to share things on the internet,
I release most of it publically, there are some private things,
I am sorting through it and expect it will change drastically,
I understand there is not much I can do about this respository being used freely,
I am aware that is okay too, if you want to help out feel free to do so,
I am practicing these technologies most of my experience is elsewhere,
Feel free to send a recommendation or two my way,

Please do not charge for these products they are there to help people,
Maybe some day I will write a book but thats more my own accomplishment,
Payments I have requested in the past was because I was either employed,
Or because I was kinda seeking enough money to keep living outside my childhood home,
Admittedly at the hope I would not have to stop work on my thesis or writing,
I have added a license charging a ton of money before because I left some personal memories,
And if anyone wanted to read about my entire life I at least wanted a few portions, quid, dollars,

After being hacked a whole lot, spending a ton of money to replace compromised computers,
Kinda got sick of it, especially when the mathematics I was trying to share to help got deleted,
So the stuff I push here is mostly to glean information from the internet so I can do stuff offline,
That way I am a little happier and whoever decided my computer was fair game does as well,
That sounded a little harsh when I typed it going to move past any grudges now,

With all that in mind, if you decide to use any of this stuff do so with good intentions please,
Not swearing to this next line but working towards if I download anything, then it changes,
I will check to make sure it matches up with current postings,
Although if it gets included in any machine learning algorithms,
I might be able to remove it somehow but that is why I mention it here,
Otherwise stuff will be kept offline and maybe a resume online (and emailing grandparents :) ),

Putting all this here in the license folder so that it is more weighted on your concious,
The license itself is technically binding but I still need to study a lot to stop any hacking,
