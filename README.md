for discussing public problems from anywhere

i'm playing around with python programming as i am old and decrepid,
nobody is working on me with this so the only code pushed you'll see for a while,
are when i get paranoid about loosing my changes and want to back this up,
could i use another branch, yes, will i? not after what happened in 2013
