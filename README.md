the parkinsons research is on pause until i get my accounts deleted and organized, somebody keeps adding old files to my phone for some reason,
the poems was a partner effort from 2015, that's why it's kinda jarbled,
the other journal stuff is notes i meant to push from a while ago, it has more i might push later on,

using my mom's computer, still going insane, going with my hunch here can somebody please tell me sadie my daughter-doge is alive, 
as for her mom, meh, it is alright either way, pretty sure she taught her how to do this, thank you
