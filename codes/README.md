the functions and programs here help me manage my applications for work,
and manage my timestamps and recover from "$ backlogged timestamp that built up thus meaning debt"
that's why there here and not separated into another repository,
if you like them or copy them please throw a watch or something so i know it's not just me

it's not clean, and for now doesn't have much duplicated code,
but for use in anything production level it needs refactoring,
i might expand it to a library one day but for now it's a collection of functions
