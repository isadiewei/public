# Machine Learning Guide

## Different Models

### Decision Trees

- interpretable
- data
  - categorical
  - numerical
- identification of important features
- useful for understanding logic

### Naive Bayes

- simple
- fast
- many features capable
- independence assumption

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- intuative
- simple datasets
- easily interpreted

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)

- high dimensional data
- non-linear kernel tricks
- high classification accuracy

### Random Forest

- combines multiple decision trees
- improves prediction accuracy
- reduces overfitting
- generalization ability
- some interpretability

### Gradient Boosting

- regression versus classification
- complex relationships
- interpretability

## Key points 

### Interpretability:

If understanding the reasoning behind predictions is crucial, choose models like decision trees or Naive Bayes. 

### Data complexity

For complex non-linear data, consider SVMs or ensemble methods like Random Forest. 

### Computational efficiency

For large datasets, prioritize models like Naive Bayes or KNN that are computationally fast. 

### Task type

Select a model suited for your specific task, whether it's classification, regression, or clustering.
